# DIASTASE Project: Exploring Hierarchical vs. Sequential Processing in Language

This project is dedicated to advancing our understanding of how the human brain processes language.
## Project Overview

Language is a complex cognitive function that is fundamental to human communication. Sentences in natural languages exhibit a hierarchical structure, often represented by linguists as nested trees. Understanding sentence meaning requires the human brain to construct these complex syntactic structures when in fact receiving the words sequentially. Alongside this hierarchical processing mechanism, there might exist a simpler, linear form of processing that deals with word-by-word sequences. This sequential processing is thought to be evolutionarily older and might potentially interfere with the more complex hierarchical structure processing, leading to errors in sentence comprehension.

The DIASTASE project explores this concept further by examining whether these two processing types - hierarchical and sequential - coexist and how they interact. The project aims to dissect whether sentence-processing errors stem from working memory interference between words or from conflicting local versus long-distance word prediction signals.
